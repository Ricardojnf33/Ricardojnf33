ðŸ“Š Overview of My GitHub Profile ðŸ“Š

Hello, I'm Ricardo, a passionate data enthusiast with a focus on Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. Over the past two years, I have been dedicated to self-learning and pursuing my goal of becoming a senior data scientist within the next five years.

As part of my master's degree program in engineering and data analysis, I have been actively involved in machine learning projects, honing my skills in data analysis, pattern recognition, and report writing. During this time, I have also expanded my proficiency in the English language. For the past two years, I have worked as a researcher at "Comunidade-DS," contributing to projects that utilize the CRISP-DM approach to extract valuable insights from data and tackle real-world business challenges.

To establish myself as a marketable data analyst, I plan to undertake and execute projects that showcase my ability to manipulate, collect, clean, and analyze data from diverse sources in order to draw meaningful conclusions and provide guidance for informed business decisions. For data manipulation, I utilize powerful tools such as Python and SQL, along with libraries like beautifulsoup and Selenium for web scraping. I employ data visualization techniques using matplotlib and seaborn to present my findings in a clear and understandable manner.

In addition to my technical skills, I have spent the past year and a half actively engaged in educational projects involving both supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches. This experience has allowed me to develop predictive models and identify patterns in data. Furthermore, my strong familiarity with the CRISP-DM approach enables me to define business challenges, locate appropriate data sources, and implement effective solutions. As part of my final course assignment, I present a work on a data science project where I am employing the CRISP-DM methodology and various machine learning algorithms to construct a compelling case study that addresses a relevant business question.

Overall, I believe I am well-prepared to contribute as a data analyst. This role demands collaboration with stakeholders to understand their requirements and offer data-driven insights that facilitate informed decision-making. I am skilled at effectively communicating my discoveries through oral presentations and written reports. Furthermore, I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and adapt to emerging trends and techniques.
