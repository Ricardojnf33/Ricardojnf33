# Data Science Researcher

Hello! My name is Ricardo Fernandes, and I am a Data Science Researcher and Prompt Engineer passionate about unveiling the mysteries of Artificial Intelligence and driving the future with innovative solutions. With over three years of experience in data science research and specialization in analyzing, visualizing data, developing machine learning models, and generating actionable insights, I am at the forefront of the AI revolution.

# My experience

Currently, I am engaged with AiBox Lab / Softex in Recife, where I develop advanced AI and telemetry solutions, including a proactive fleet monitoring system using data clustering and telemetry to detect abnormal driver behaviors. My projects have involved robust data pipelines with PostgreSQL, machine learning model training, and data management with Python and Docker.

Previously, I worked with the DS Community in SÃ£o Paulo on various impactful projects, such as developing a managerial dashboard for a food delivery marketplace in India and creating an AI assistant for SQL in Snowflake using the GPT-3 model from OpenAI. These projects are accessible via my GitHub links below.

# Current projects

## AI Assistant for SQL in Snowflake

I developed an AI assistant capable of interpreting natural language queries and converting them into SQL commands for the Snowflake database, using the LangChain framework and GPT-3.

## Telecommunication AI for Fleet Management

Developing a system for fleet management using advanced telemetry and machine learning to enhance operational efficiency and safety.

The Artificial Intelligence Revolution

I believe that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the next big revolution and I'm excited to be a part of it. AI has the potential to solve many of the world's most pressing problems, from climate change to poverty. I'm working with 3 simultaneous consultants CLAUDE3, GEMINI and ChatGPT-Plus to develop new ways to use AI to solve real world problems.

I'm excited to see what the future holds for AI and I'm committed to using my skills to make a difference in the world.```
