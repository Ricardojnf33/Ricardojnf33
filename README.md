Hi, my name is Ricardo and I have been studying daily for last couple years and today I consider myself a data analyst. I am currently completing my postgraduate degree in engineering and data analysis where I have been working on machine learning projects such as part of my studies. I acquired skills by producing private projects to gain experience in data analysis, identifying patterns and trends, and writing reports in English. I am also a member of the "Comunidade-DS" , a community where I am at one year and a half as a researcher, producing projects where I apply all processes to extract insights from data to solve real business problems using CRISP-DM methodology.

In order to become a data analyst hired by the market, I develop tasks carrying out projects to practice data manipulation skills, collect, clean and analyze data from various sources to extract insights and inform business decisions. I use programming languages like Python and MySQL to manipulate data and I use tools like beautifulsoup, Selenium to perform web scraping tasks. I also use data visualization tools like matplotlib and seaborn to create dashboards and present my findings clearly and concisely.

In addition to these technical skills, I have one year and eight months of experience developing pedagogical projects with supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, which allow me to build predictive models and identify patterns in data. I am also familiar with the CRISP-DM methodology, which guides me through the process of defining business problems, identifying relevant data sources, and implementing solutions. As a final course work, I am developing a data science project where I present a case study of the use of machine learning algorithms with CRISP-DM methodology to help answer a market question.


Overall, I feel prepared to deliver a role as a data analyst where it involves working closely with stakeholders to understand their needs and provide data-driven insights that support informed decision-making. I am comfortable communicating my findings verbally and in writing, and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and keep up with the latest trends in the field.
