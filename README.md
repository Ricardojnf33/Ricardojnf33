My name is Ricardo, and I've been a self-taught student of data science for the past two years, with the goal of becoming a senior data scientist in the next five. Given my background, I now consider myself a competent data analyst. As part of my master's degree program in engineering and data analysis, I've been working on machine learning projects. By working on personal projects, I was able to hone my skills in data analysis, pattern recognition, and report writing while expanding my English language proficiency. I've been a researcher at the "Comunidade-DS" for the past two years, contributing to projects in which I use the CRISP-DM approach to extract insights from data and address actual business challenges.

In order to become a marketable data analyst, I plan to build and carry out projects to show my ability to manipulate data, collect, clean, and analyze data from a variety of sources in order to draw conclusions and guide business decisions. For data manipulation, I use beautifulsoup and Selenium to web scraping and collect data, store in datawharehouses like Heroku and Python and SQL to manipulate and analyse the data, using dashboard-building with  and presentation tools like matplotlib and seaborn to convey my findings in an understandable manner.

In addition to these technical abilities, I have worked for the past year and a half constructing educational projects using supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches, which have allowed me to construct prediction models and spot patterns in data. In addition, I am well-versed in the CRISP-DM approach, which helps me define business challenges, locate appropriate data sources, and execute appropriate solutions. Final course assignment is a data science project, and I'm using the CRISP-DM methodology and machine learning algorithms to construct a case study to help solve a business question.


Overall, I believe I am prepared to contribute as a data analyst, a position that calls for me to collaborate directly with stakeholders to learn about their requirements and then offer data-driven insights to aid in making educated decisions. I have no trouble reporting my discoveries both orally and in writing, and I am constantly on the lookout for new methods to learn and adapt.


Skills:

Language: Python, MySQL.
- Web Scraping: Python (beautifulsoup, selenium).
- Data Engineering: MySQL Server, ETL, Airflow.
- Data Cleaning & Manipulation: Python (numpy, pandas).
- Data Visualization & Dashboard: Python (matplotlib, seaborn).
- Machine Learning: Supervised Learning Methods (linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, KNN, random forests...), Unsupervised Learning Methods (kmeans, hierarchical clustering...).
- WebApp: Streamlit. 
 
General approach to problem-solving: Asking an LLM, like ChatGPT, the right question to find answer.
