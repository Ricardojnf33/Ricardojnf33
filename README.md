# My GitHub profile

My name is Ricardo Fernandes and I'm a Data Scientist looking for a career change. I am certified by Cesar Scool as a Data Specialist. I believe that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the next big revolution and I'm excited to be a part of it.

# My experience

I have studied data science for over 3 years, and since ChatGPT was created in November 2022, I have been studying the field of artificial intelligence, specifically large language models (LLMs). Python, PostgressSQL, Picone for Vector Databases, Streamlit visualization, AWS (when needed), and Prompting Engineering with the best LLMs on the market are all languages I know well. I'm a creative and innovative problem solver, and I'm constantly considering fresh approaches to using data to address issues in the real world. I also have methods for developing any solution step-by-step. With I.A., ask and I'll find out.

# My current projects

# Projects in progress

## Creator of Cheetah Data Science

Disseminating knowledge in Artificial Intelligence for everyone. Offering a Prompt Engineering Course with ChatGPT and an eBook with 1000+ prompts (Coming soon). Comprehensive training to excel in the AI revolution.

## Chatbot Web App

I built a chatbot web application in Streamlit with the Langchain framework. I'm using off-the-shelf open source templates to create a chatbot that can provide customer support, answer questions, and even schedule appointments. The chatbot is being tested and will be deployed soon.

**Tools used:**

- streamlit
- Langchain
- Open source templates

## PDF Chatbot

I'm developing a chatbot web application that can interact with PDF documents. The chatbot will be able to extract information from the PDFs, answer questions about the documents and even summarize their contents. This tool has the potential to be valuable for businesses and individuals who need to deal with PDF documents.

**Tools used:**

- streamlit
- Langchain
- PDF extraction and summary tools

## Website Chatbot

I'm building a chatbot for primary care, providing customer support and answering questions. The chatbot will be integrated into the customer's website and use prompt engineering in conjunction with an LLM to conduct conversations based on the customer's company information. This will allow the chatbot to provide personalized information to website visitors, which can improve the user experience and increase conversions.

**Tools used:**

- streamlit
- Langchain
- LLM
- Prompt engineering tools (CoT) Chain of Thought

## DO IT ALL WITH OpenAI app

Explore the power of OpenAI Artificial Intelligence in your PDF documents, dataframes and various file types. You can also use OpenAI in web searches. Join the AI revolution right now!

**Tools used:**

- streamlit
- Langchain
- LLM ( OpenAI )
- Prompt engineering tools (CoT) Chain of Thought

```The Artificial Intelligence Revolution

I believe that Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the next big revolution and I'm excited to be a part of it. AI has the potential to solve many of the world's most pressing problems, from climate change to poverty. I'm working with 3 simultaneous consultants CLAUDE2, BARD and ChatGPT to develop new ways to use AI to solve real world problems.

CLAUDE2

CLAUDE2 is a large model language (LLM) developed by Antropic. It is trained on a huge dataset of text and code and can generate text, translate languages, analyse different kind's of data and make precise decision.  write different types of creative content and answer your questions in an informative way and it's up to date. Act like a senior code generator.


BARD

BARD is a large model language (LLM) developed by Google AI. It is trained on a huge dataset of text and code and can generate text, translate languages, write different types of creative content and answer your questions in an informative way and it's also up to date. Act like a senior code generator.


ChatGPT

ChatGPT is a large model language (LLM) developed by OpenAI. It is trained on a huge dataset of text and code and can generate text, translate languages, write different types of creative content and answer your questions in an informative way. Act like a senior code generator.

I'm excited to see what the future holds for AI and I'm committed to using my skills to make a difference in the world.```
